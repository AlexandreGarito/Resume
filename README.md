## Summary


I am a highly motivated junior data engineer with a strong passion for technology. I am a fast learner and
constantly strive for self-improvement, always eager to take on new challenges and expand my skillset. I honed
those traits through 5 years of professional exploration.
Over the past five years, I ventured on an exploratory journey, initiating six different business projects in various
professional areas. Out of those projects, three generated revenue (albeit with suboptimal margins), two failed or
one was aborted. These experiences have allowed me to discover my passion for programming and technology,
as well as develop strong learning skills and a high degree of autonomy.
I funded this journey through a personal investment in Bitcoin, which I actively managed using my analytical skills
and a level-headed approach. Despite 5 years of high market volatility, I exited my investment with a 25x return on
my initial capital.
Now, with a better understanding of my career interests, I am ready to focus on the technology sector. I've realized
that achieving great ambitions in this field requires collaboration and teamwork. I am eager to work with others,
contribute my skills, and pursue bigger goals together in the tech industry.
